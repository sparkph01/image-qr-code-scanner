## FAQ

#### There are lot of other packages. Why did you created this one?
I have used and tested several in production but none of them was able to give me results what I wanted which was accurate results and multiple QR scanning in image. So, I created this one and used python in it as it was more mature and accurate libraries for this use case.

#### Will you regularly update this library?
Yes. I will be keeping tabs on this one.

#### I found a bug what should I do?
Create a new issue. I will take a look at it. 

#### I don't want to use your package. What other option do I have?
